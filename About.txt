////Game Functionality:
Card Display and Interaction:

The shuffle function randomizes the order of the cards.
Each card is represented by a <div> element with a specific class and data attributes.
Clicking on a card triggers the flipCard function, which flips the card, reveals the symbol, and starts the timer.
Timer Countdown:

The startTimer function initializes a countdown timer.
The timer is displayed on the webpage, updating every second.
If the timer reaches zero, an alert is displayed, prompting the player to retry the game.
Matching Logic:

When two cards are flipped (flippedCards array has two elements), the checkMatch function is called after a 1-second delay.
The function compares the symbols of the flipped cards.
If the symbols match, the cards are marked as "matched," and the matchedPairs counter increases.
If all pairs are matched, a congratulations alert is displayed, and the game is reset.
Game Reset:

The resetGame function resets the game state.
It clears the game board, reshuffles the cards, resets the timer, and sets up event listeners for the new cards.
Shuffling Effect:

The shuffleCardsWithEffect function adds a shuffling effect between levels.
It rotates the game board by 180 degrees, clears the board, shuffles the cards, and rotates the board back to 0 degrees.
Game Flow:
Player clicks on a card to flip it.
Timer starts counting down from 20 seconds.
Player clicks on a second card to reveal its symbol.
The game checks if the symbols match.
If yes, cards stay flipped, and the player aims to match the next pair.
If no, cards flip back face-down.
Player repeats the process until all pairs are matched or the timer runs out.
A congratulatory message or a time-up alert is displayed, and the player can choose to retry.
